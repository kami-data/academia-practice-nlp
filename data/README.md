# /data Folder

This folder is used to store input and intermediate datasets (e.g., cleaned case studies).  
Files here are excluded from version control via `.gitignore` to avoid uploading large or sensitive data.

**Expected files:**
- `merged_impact_case_studies.csv` – raw input data (not tracked)
- `cleaned_impact_case_studies.csv` – preprocessed file used in the NLP pipeline
