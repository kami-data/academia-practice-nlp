# Academia–Practice Interaction Mapping Using NLP

This project uses Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract non-academic organizations from social impact case studies submitted by Polish universities to the POL-on system. The goal is to identify practice partners and analyze the network of academic–nonacademic interactions in the context of societal impact.

---

##  What this project does

- Loads and cleans text from Polish-language impact case study reports
- Applies two NER models:
  - [`Stanza`](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza) (Stanford NLP)
  - [`Davlan/xlm-roberta-base-finetuned-ner`](https://huggingface.co/Davlan/xlm-roberta-base-ner-hrl) via Hugging Face
- Extracts named entities labeled as `ORG` (organizations)
- Filters out academic institutions using keyword-based rules
- Identifies and manually annotates a shared subset of entities (“common entities”) extracted by both models
- Develops rule-based and ML classification logic on this ground-truth set
- Applies classification rules to remaining entities (in progress)

## Modular NLP Pipeline

This project is divided into five Jupyter notebooks, each handling a specific stage of the workflow:

| Notebook | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `01_data_preparation.ipynb` | Clean and structure raw Polish-language case study text |
| `02_ner_extraction.ipynb`   | Extract named entities (`ORG`) using two NER models |
| `03_entity_analysis.ipynb`  | Compare and evaluate entity extraction performance |
| `04_common_entity_preprocessing.ipynb` | Normalize and clean common entity names |
| `05_common_entity_classification.ipynb` | Sample and label organization types for typology |
| `06_common_entities_categorized.ipynb` | Integrate manual annotations and finalize the labeled set |
| `07_apply_rules_to_stanza_entities.ipynb` | Extend classification logic to Stanza-only entities |

## How to Run This Project


1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Download the input dataset from the official RAD-on portal:  
   [Opisy wpływu działalności naukowej na funkcjonowanie społeczeństwa i gospodarki](https://radon.nauka.gov.pl/dane/opisy-wplywu-dzialalnosci-naukowej-na-funkcjonowanie-spoleczenstwa-i-gospodarki)  
   and place the CSV file into the `data/` folder.

3. Run each notebook in order, following the modular structure.

4. All outputs (NER results, labeled entities, trained models) will be saved to the output/ folder.
