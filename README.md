# Academiaâ€“Practice Interaction Mapping Using NLP

This project uses Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract non-academic organizations from social impact case studies submitted by Polish universities to the POL-on system. The goal is to identify practice partners and analyze the network of academicâ€“nonacademic interactions in the context of societal impact.

---

##  What this project does

- Loads and cleans text from Polish-language impact case study reports
- Applies two NER models:
  - [`Stanza`](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza) (Stanford NLP)
  - [`Davlan/xlm-roberta-base-finetuned-ner`](https://huggingface.co/Davlan/xlm-roberta-base-ner-hrl) via Hugging Face
- Extracts and compares named entities of type `ORG`
- Filters out academic institutions using keyword matching
- Outputs lists of potential non-academic partners for further analysis
